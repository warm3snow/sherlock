## Sherlock - AI-powered SSH Remote Operations Tool

Sherlock is an AI-based remote operations tool built on SSH. It enables you to interact with remote hosts using natural language commands.

### Why Sherlock Over Traditional SSH?

| Feature | Traditional SSH | Sherlock |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Natural Language Support** | ❌ Requires memorizing commands | ✅ Describe tasks in plain language |
| **Command History & Saved Hosts** | ❌ Manual management required | ✅ Automatic login history and host management |
| **Automation** | ❌ Requires scripting knowledge | ✅ AI-powered task automation |
| **Learning Curve** | ❌ Steep learning curve for beginners | ✅ Intuitive natural language interface |
| **Multi-step Operations** | ❌ Manual command chaining | ✅ AI understands complex tasks |
| **Cross-language Support** | ❌ English commands only | ✅ Supports commands in multiple languages |

#### Key Advantages

1. **🗣️ Natural Language Interface** - No need to memorize complex shell commands. Simply describe what you want to do in plain English or Chinese, and Sherlock will translate it to the appropriate commands.

2. **📜 Smart History Management** - Sherlock automatically saves your connection history and host information, allowing you to quickly reconnect to previous servers with a simple `connect <id>` command.

3. **🤖 AI-Powered Automation** - Complex multi-step operations become simple one-line requests. The AI understands context and can execute sophisticated workflows automatically.

4. **🔑 Automatic SSH Key Management** - Sherlock handles SSH key authentication seamlessly. After your first password-based connection, it automatically sets up key-based authentication for future logins.

5. **🌍 Multi-language Support** - Interact with your servers in your preferred language. Sherlock understands commands in both English and Chinese.

6. **🔌 Multiple LLM Providers** - Choose from local (Ollama) or cloud-based (OpenAI, DeepSeek) AI providers based on your privacy and performance needs.

### Features

1. **Natural Language Connection** - Connect to remote hosts by describing what you want in plain language
2. **Automatic SSH Key Management** - After password-based connection, automatically adds your local SSH public key to the remote host's authorized_keys for future passwordless authentication
3. **AI-powered Command Execution** - Describe what you want to do in natural language, and Sherlock will translate it to shell commands
4. **Multiple LLM Provider Support** - Works with local Ollama, DeepSeek, or OpenAI APIs using the CloudWeGo Eino framework

### Installation

#### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/warm3snow/Sherlock.git
cd Sherlock

# Build
go build -o sherlock ./cmd/sherlock

# Optional: Install to $GOPATH/bin
go install ./cmd/sherlock
```

### Configuration

Sherlock uses a JSON configuration file. The default location is `~/.config/sherlock/config.json`.

#### SSH Key Auto-Detection

Sherlock automatically detects SSH keys from the `~/.ssh/` directory. It prioritizes `id_ed25519` over `id_rsa`. If neither key is found, a warning message is displayed and password authentication will be used.

You typically don't need to configure SSH keys manually. If you want to override the auto-detection, you can specify the paths in the configuration file:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "ollama",
    "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
    "model": "qwen2.5:7b",
    "temperature": 0.7
  },
  "ssh_key": {
    "private_key_path": "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
    "public_key_path": "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub",
    "auto_add_to_remote": true
  },
  "shell_commands": {
    "whitelist": ["mycustomcmd", "another-cmd"]
  },
  "ui": {
    "theme": "dracula"
  }
}
```

**Note:** The `ssh_key` section is optional. If omitted, Sherlock will auto-detect SSH keys.

#### UI Themes

Sherlock supports three color themes for the interactive shell:

- **default** - Simple monochrome theme (no colors)
- **dracula** - Popular dark theme with purple/pink accents
- **solarized** - Professional color scheme with blue/cyan tones

To change the theme, add the `ui` section to your configuration file:

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "theme": "dracula"
  }
}
```

#### Shell Commands Whitelist

You can add custom shell commands to the whitelist. These commands will be executed directly without LLM translation, improving execution efficiency.

```json
{
  "shell_commands": {
    "whitelist": ["mycustomcmd", "another-cmd", "custom-script"]
  }
}
```

#### LLM Providers

**Ollama (Local)**
```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "ollama",
    "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
    "model": "qwen2.5:7b"
  }
}
```

**OpenAI**
```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "api_key": "your-api-key",
    "model": "gpt-4"
  }
}
```

**DeepSeek**
```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "deepseek",
    "api_key": "your-api-key",
    "model": "deepseek-chat"
  }
}
```

### Usage

#### Start Interactive Mode

```bash
sherlock
```

#### Show Saved Hosts

```bash
sherlock hosts
```

This shows all previously connected hosts. You can then connect using `connect <id>`.

```bash
sherlock [options] [command]
